        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <h2>This is Sanchit Raj.</h2>
        <h3>I'm a <span class="wd">Web Developer</span>, <span class="ds">Data Science learner</span>  and a <span class="atc">Air Traffic Controller aspirant.</span></h3>
        <p>I have been doing Web Development from 2 weeks now and currently planning to improve on this skill. I have been following <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp</a> course by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/">Angela Yu</a>. It is very intresting how i started as to become Data Scienctist since 3rd sem and now also want to add the skills of Web Developer.This is because of the lack of opportunity for a B.Tech. candidate in the field of data. Although i have planned to use my very own machine learning models in my websites to make it work for many newer problems. This idea is there in my head because i never wanted to quit data science. It is been well stablish that focusing on one this is the best you can do to learn new skills but i have to manage it. Just have a leap of faith and do it.Things will be easier and will be according to plan. Just it will take some time. <br>
        Also I will start my ATC prepration for 6th sem (during the 8 months break for interships). When I was 16, this was with me and now i feel focused to achieve it. Just have faith and keep your head down and WORK.</p>
